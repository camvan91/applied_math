\part{Partial Differential Equations}


This part of the text needs a lot of work.  There are quite a few exercises,
but there is not much accompanying text.  \cite{haberman:2003} has a very
accessible treatment of the material.  See \cite{garabedian:1998} for 
a more advanced treatment.  \cite{zwillinger:1992} is an excellent reference.
\cite{weinberger:1965} and \cite{guenther:1988} are also good texts (and
affordable as they are published by Dover).
